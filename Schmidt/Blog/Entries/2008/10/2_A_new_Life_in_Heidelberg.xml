    <richText>Since the last entry in my blog, i have moved to Heidelberg in southern Germany to start a new life as PhD student at MPIA in Heidelberg. Actually so far the picture above (my office) describes all I have experienced so far. There has been A LOT of paperwork, bank, institute, insurance, etc., and I&#x2019;m afraid there is plenty left. Furthermore I have been moving around since for the first month or so I only have temporary places to live. On the left are some pictures from an apartment I lived in the first week, and on right the apartment I&#x2019;m living in at the time (see also the picture section). Luckily I have found a place to live permanently from the first of november, so one month and I&#x2019;m settled for good here. It&#x2019;s a  small flat on 30 m^2 with a small kitchen and a bathroom located in the southern part of the city, a place called Rohrbach. So from November 1st I&#x2019;m ready for visitors;)&#xD;Saturday I&#x2019;m planing to go see a bit more of the city if the weather allows it, and tomorrow I&#x2019;m wondering of taking a run alongside the Neckar river. Just to get out a bit, and not get stuck in the work already. That can wait until my last year and the approaching of the hand-in of my thesis ;)&#xD;Beside that there is not much to tell about my new life down here - but I&#x2019;m sure that much will come! &#xD;(keep an eye on the photo section;)</richText>
