    <richText>Mette and I decided to enjoy the last day of the summer, August 31, in copenhagen Zoo. We were wuite lucky both with the weather and with the feeding of the animals. We saw the lions &#x2018;attacking&#x2019; their dinner and the sealions doing tricks in order to get theirs. Furthermore we had seen neither the new elefant house nor the hippo-house, which was hilarious. Huge clumps of fat and flesh (= hippo&#x2019;s) which really can&#x2019;t swim, and therefore slowly moves through the water by jumping on the bottom - beautiful:D So indeed it was a great day - hope the Zoo in Heidelberg is as much fun as the Copenhagen one...</richText>
