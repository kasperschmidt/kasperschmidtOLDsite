    <richText>The 14th of August I earned my masters degree in astrophysics from the Dark Cosmology Center at the University of Copenhagen. The day was rather hectic. For a couple of weeks I had been preparing the defence of my thesis. And eventhough I knew what to say my nerves were indeed still present when I gave my talk at 1315 in the auditorium at the Rockefeller kompleks. Fortunately everything went well and I didn&#x2019;t stumble or got caught in long unnecessary explanations. When I finished my talk the around 50 people who were there were invited for a drink in the DARK lounge. There my supervisor announce my grade, which was enough for me to be able to accept a Job offer from MPIA in Heidelberg. Because of that I&#x2019;m now about to move to Germany. Right now I&#x2019;m trying to get everything sorted out so that my arrival will go as smoothly as possible, but there are quite some things to take care of when you are moving to another country, accommodation, taxes, bank accounts, etc. In the future I will hopefully get some time to keep my blog updated so that if people are interested in my whereabouts they can be updated here.  </richText>
