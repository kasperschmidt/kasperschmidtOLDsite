    <richText>So my last couple of days in Heidelberg are getting close. I have been swamped with bureaucratic stuff the last week or so, as there was a lot of paper work to be done with the thesis, moving, etc. But I think I managed to fix it all and I&#x2019;m now (paper-wise) ready to move back to DK for a month or so where even more paper work is waiting - they really want to make sure that you are not taking advantage of them and the system in the US.&#xD;&#xD;Last weekend was tough. As I mentioned last time I had a lot of celebration to do and as I&#x2019;m not getting younger and everyone seemed up for helping me with that, the weekend really got the better of me. But damn it it was good! Managed to say bye to both Untere Strasse and Le Cave, and especially Le Cave (and my age - I&#x2019;m too old for 3-night-in-a-row-drinking) meant that I didn&#x2019;t get fully over the weekend before wednesday. But it was worth it. Thanks guys!!&#xD;&#xD;During the week I have slowly but steadily been picking up on work and this weekend will be much quieter (I think) than the last one as I have a flat to clean and paint before I leave HD on wednesday. Because of the painting I have been getting rid of all my stuff. Most of the things I want to bring with me to the US, my parents drove back to DK last week, my office stuff is being send, and the rest of it is up for grabs or is being sold. This means that my flat is getting pretty empty: The couch will be gone tomorrow and then all that is left is my armchair, the micro-oven, and my 5 drawer chest. So last night I was enjoying my dinner in front of the laptop using the last two moving boxes as table and slept on my air-bed; what a wonderful life ;)&#xD;&#xD;Well, as I&#x2019;m leaving on wednesday it won&#x2019;t last long. I just have to get this painting stuff over with and then it&#x2019;s back to DK. Looking forward to it... till then - cheers!&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;</richText>
