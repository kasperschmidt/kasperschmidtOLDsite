For christmas I went to northern Jutland to visit some family with my parents and brother. We were only there for around 24 hours, but it was really nice to see the family - I think it has been like 6 months or so. <div style="height: 182px; width: 242px;  clear: right; float: right; height: 182px; margin: 12px 0px 12px 12px; position: relative; width: 242px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_1 inline-block"><img src="18_Back_in_business_files/S5002568.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 182px; width: 242px; " /></div>We had a lot of excellent traditional danish food and some beers, wine and snaps with that - I love danish traditions;) Christmas eve we went around the christmas tree and exchanged presents. I got a lot of cool stuff, among this a new camera - really cool - so I hope that there will be a lot more <a title="http://web.me.com/kasperschmidt/old/cool_pics.html" href="http://web.me.com/kasperschmidt/old/cool_pics.html">cool pics</a> in the future.<br /></div>
                <div class="paragraph paragraph_style">When we came back to Funen where my parents and parents ‘in law’ live there was no time for me to just sit down and relax. First there was a family lunch at Mette’s parents. It was nice also to see them, now that I was back in DK.<div style="height: 240px; width: 180px;  clear: left; float: left; height: 239px; margin: 12px 12px 12px 0px; position: relative; width: 180px; " class="tinyText inline-block"><div style="position: relative; width: 180px; "><img src="18_Back_in_business_files/shapeimage_1.png" alt="" style="height: 240px; left: 0px; position: absolute; top: 0px; width: 180px; " /></div></div> We had a ‘package-game’ where I was lucky not to get the ‘hate-present’ which is a 30 cm plastic pixie for the garden, which is really ugly even though it might have enjoyed a year in Germany... well I’m glad I didn’t ‘win’ it - sorry for you Birgit :)<br /></div>
                <div class="paragraph paragraph_style">The day after we had christmas lunch at my parents place together with my uncle and ant. We had a lot of food and snaps and people got a bit drunk (read: quite drunk). But it was great seeing them again. Unfortunately my cousins couldn’t come. Especially Nik I haven’t seen for like... 2-3 years so it would be nice to see him again - maybe next year!<div style="height: 207px; width: 249px;  clear: right; float: right; height: 207px; margin: 12px 0px 12px 12px; position: relative; width: 249px; " class="tinyText inline-block"><div style="position: relative; width: 249px; "><img src="18_Back_in_business_files/shapeimage_2.png" alt="" style="height: 207px; left: 0px; position: absolute; top: 0px; width: 249px; " /></div></div><br /></div>
                <p class="paragraph_style">At as if it wasn’t enough I had a third lunch with my high school classmates. We still see one another more less twice a year for a summer party and a christmas lunch which is really cool. This year Mette P. (again, which we all really appreciate) held the party and we were quite a lot that showed up. We again ate and drank a lot (yeat another hurray for danish traditions and pork) and had a really good time - Thanks everybody, and hope you were not to bad the next day Bille ;)<br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph paragraph_style">After having seen most of the family and many of old friends Mette and I went back to Copenhagen to celebrate new years eve with some other friends<div style="height: 185px; width: 245px;  clear: left; float: left; height: 185px; margin: 12px 12px 12px 0px; position: relative; width: 245px; " class="tinyText inline-block"><div style="position: relative; width: 245px; "><img src="18_Back_in_business_files/shapeimage_3.png" alt="" style="height: 185px; left: 0px; position: absolute; top: 0px; width: 245px; " /></div></div>. Mette had to work a couple of days during christmas and new years eve, which I then used to do a bit of work and to meet with Jacob and a couple of my friends from University of Copenhagen. New years eve was really great - not a huge monkey-party, but really down to earth with great food and good friends - that’s how it’s suppose to be!<br /></div>
                <p class="paragraph_style">In the beginning of January Mette and I just enjoyed the last days together before I had to go back to Heidelberg. I came back on the 5th and have since then just tried to get into gear again. For some reason I always feel tired and exhausted after a couple of weeks of. This time I however think there was a good reason - it can’t be healthy with so much pork and alcohol in only 14 days!<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">But eventually I succeeded to get into gear and the work is going great. I have a lot to do since I’m leaving for the states February 7, and since they want me to give a talk there and I have an upcoming IMPRS talk I’m not bored! I’m not sure I’ll have the time to right once more before I leave for ‘The Land of God’, but I’ll try to keep you updated from there.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Cheers &amp; a late happy 2009<br /></p>
