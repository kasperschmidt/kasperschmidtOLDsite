                <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style">A couple of weeks ago I went to DK to take my PADI Open Water scuba diving certificate - finally... well at least I thought so. Unfortunately I was the only participant and since they need 3-4 participants to give the course they told me that I wouldn’t be diving :’( so I went to Denmark just to work... and on top of that Mette wasn’t even there to keep me entertained in the evenings, since she was on school. She have just started her new education as pharmacologist and every now and then she has to go three weeks to Hillerød to learn stuff, which she can then turn into practical knowledge at the pharmacy in Odense; and unfortunately se had one of her school periods when I was in DK... of course this wouldn’t have been a problem if I was diving like hell - but I was not, so I really missed her. I instead spend my evening with some of my friend, and my parents which was of course really nice... but it would still haven been a bit better i Mette had been there... well I survived the weekdays and really enjoyed the weekend with her!<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">After working a week from Denmark I went back to Germany to continue the work and start preparing myself for my first Oktoberfest! A couple of weeks went and it became the 26th  of September (yeah okay - it was not october, but still;) and since we went to the frühlingsfest in ... bobbob ... was it april - i think it was - we have been planning to go to the herbstfest in Stuttgart, which is supposed to be the second largest Oktoberfest in the world, only topped by the famous one in Munich. The plan was to wear Lederhosen, but unfortunately we couldn’t find any cheaper than 80 euros! And since we are still kind of student we decided not to do it after all (renting wasn’t really that much cheaper). Well even though we weren’t wearing Lederhosen we went to Stuttgart early saturday morning to get some beer and sunshine. The weather was great and so was the mood. We arrived at the Canstatter Wasen around 13ish and went straight for the first the best beer tent - and what a tent! Beers in 1 liter mugs - the famous and beloved Maß and girls in the bavarian dress Dirndl and men in Lederhosen and hats, all singing german Slagers and drinking beer. Germany is actually not bad regarding party with and because of beer - great idea! So after having check out the tent we found a table and a couple of benches and ordered our first Maß - and damn they were good... too good... one thought that being closer to 30 than 20 a man should know his limit, and so I do - if I just know what I’m drinking. I thought I was drink ordinary beer, but no no no - yesterday I heard that the alcohol percentage of the Oktoberfest beers is 5.9vol% which would have been really good to know beforehand! Well I had the first 4 Maß in an hour or two and was rollin’. We left the first tent to go’ and have some rides. We didn’t try any of the roller coasters but we did try some weird turning, swinging, flying thingy (there are more pictures on my Facebook profile uploaded by Mauricio) and the bumper cars. I was writing with Maria and since we only bought one ride and the others 3, Maria and I went to another tent to have yet another Maß... we ordered and enjoyed and ... black black black (2 hours later) ... I’m feeling bad ... thanks for taking care of me M&amp;M and bringing me outside, but I think I would prefer to go to the main station and wait for the rest of you guys. So I found myself at Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof really drunk and waiting for the others (who had the train tickets). They showed up around 22 and we took a train back to Heidelberg. I’m really glad that I decided not to bring my camera - I would have killed myself if something happened to it! But it was really good to be back home and sleeping in my own bed.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">It was an awesome event (at least the part I remember;) so I will for sure go next year... maybe Munich... and this time I know what I’m drinking so I (hopefully) wont be (as) drunk as this year... AND next year I REALLY want to wear Lederhosen! The pictures are gonna be great.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Actually I almost went to Munich this weekend despite the ‘breakdown’ in Stuttgart last weekend, but I couldn’t find a place to sleep (EVERYTHING is gone) so Mario and his br0ther had to go for themselves - but next year...<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">The coming week I will get back to work and just try to get the days to pass by as fast as possible, so it’ll be end October as fast as possible... why? ‘Cause Martin is visiting!!! It’s gonna be great to have a weekend with him... Jeg savner dig sgu, Brormand!<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Well till next time... Take care<br /></p>
