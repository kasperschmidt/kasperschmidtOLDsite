                <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style">Ok - finally time to blog... well time - I guess it is a matter of priorities ;)<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">So a lot to tell but to little space on the blog (read: I’m too lazy to write it all down)... where should I start? I got home from Rio last sunday after almost 20 hours on the road (that is really one of the worst things about going so far away!), after 14 days of combined work and holiday - I gotta do this again!<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">We arrived in Rio on saturday afternoon 3 weeks ago. All we did saturday was basically get something to eat, check in and just kick back and enjoy - and get our first Caipirinhas. Sunday we had to register for the IAU general assembly, which was the reason for us (me and a bunch of other guys from the institute) to be there. The weather was amazing so we spend most of the day checking out Copacabana before we registered in the afternoon. After having signed up for the conference we took a shower and went out for dinner, before we went to bet rather early (yes the geeks were actually taking the conference serious - but that’s how we are) to be ready for the next day. The next week we basically spend in a over-A/C’ed conference center getting pumped full of new exciting information and knowledge, which I for sure don’t want to recap here! Thursday we however had the afternoon off, so we went to see the famous’ Jesus statue on Corcovado. From home I checked out how to get there and found out that the funicular up the mountain would be the best and most beautiful way to get to the statue. We had also been recommended to take it since the ride should be really cool, and had actually been warned not to take one of the guides which tries to catch you attention at the entrance to the train station. And since I’m very danish I of course planned to stick to these recommendations, and just take the tourist-trap-train. But luckily I was there with a chilean and a couple of italians who of course started talking to one of the guides - he seemed like a genuine good guy, and of course he had a special offer for us. So when they said they wanted to go with him instead of the train I was VERY sceptic. But the majority decides so I got into the car and we drove up there... and DAMN A NICE TRIP!! much better than the train ride I’m sure - I’m really glad that the ‘latins’ convinced the ‘do-it-safe-scandinavian’ to go with the guide, ‘cause he was cool, we saw much more rain forest, he stopped when we wanted to, and we were taken directly back to the hotel! It was AWESOME! The Jesus statue itself was not that spectacular, but the Caipirinha behind Jesus’ back was excellent;)<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Well the conference ended friday, which we celebrated with a whole bunch of Caipis. <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Saturday we moved from the hotel to the apartment we had rented for the last week (the price of the hotel was way above our student budget!). The apartment was a cool 2 bedroom apartment, with a large kitchen, big living room and jacuzzi basically _on_ Copacabana - we actually had ocean view from the living room! And for that we only paid like 30euros per person per night, i.e., the same as a hostel bed costs per night in europe. The last week we spend mostly on the beach and in restaurants. Of course we went to the Sugar loaf (this famous mountain with the cable car) to see the sunset, but besides that we just relaxed and had fun. We also went to the quarter Lapa, which is the place you want to go out if you are in Rio. Here we by accident met the receptionist from our hotel, and her and her friends took us to a place (where I as a blond tall tourist would never go!) which was taken out of a documentary about the Rio de Janeiroian samba feeling. We went down a dirty alley and suddenly found ourselves in a crowd of young and old people dancing to samba rhythms from a dirty two-plastic-table large restaurant on the corner drinking authentic Caipirinhas made by an old lady on her small ‘wagon’ - this was really one of the coolest thing I’ve ever tried! The second time we went to Lapa though, we were alone and just did it tourist-style and went to the ‘Rio Scenarium’ (one of the worlds 10 best clubs according to The Guardian) to listen to some samba and to get ... some more Caipirinhas!<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">The last couple of days in Rio we felt that it is actually still winter down there. The temperature dropped to around 20C, it was cloudy and it rained. However, this didn’t knock us out, so we went to Santa Teresa which is a very bohemian part of Rio. Here we visited some stairs which a crazy (Chilean) guy has been covering in tiles since the late 70ies (I think it was...). They were really cool and a great way to spend a non-beach-weather-day.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Oh yes, and by the way... we also went to a football match at Maracana stadium... the match was kind of boring, and the stadium was only half full so nothing exciting to report from that.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">But as I started, I got back last sunday after a long trip. All in all I REALLY enjoyed Rio but it is also good to be back in Germany, where you don’t have to be alert 24/7 and beggars aren’t following you on the street and shouts at you if you don’t give them money... but if you can set that aside, Rio de Janeiro is definitely a place to go (and that is even without mentioning the ‘pleasures’ at/of Ipanema beach;)<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Well I think that was it... a short summary of my last 3 weeks (nothing to report from the last week where I have just been working...). I for sure forgot something, but maybe I’ll add that later or I will tell you in person some day - maybe when I get old...<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">I’m again to lazy to put pictures in the blog, so check out my picture section under the private stuff. They will give you a good idea of my experiences in RIo!<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">cheers<br /></p>
