    <richText>Well, this is gonna be a short entry since I&#x2019;m not really in the mood for blogging today and since Super Mario Bros. Wii is waiting for me ;)&#xD;I&#x2019;m now back in Heidelberg after a really nice christmas in DK. I managed to see many of my friends, spend a lot of quality time with my family and best of all I had some great days with Mette. I hope that all of you had a nice christmas as well!&#xD;I have uploaded some pictures which basically takes you through my christmas. Admitted, there are food and drinks in many of the pictures, but isn&#x2019;t that what christmas is all about?&#xD;Maybe you&#x2019;ll get some details about my christmas next time, but we&#x2019;ll have so see about that...&#xD;&#xD;Happy new year and talk to you next time&#xD;KBS</richText>
