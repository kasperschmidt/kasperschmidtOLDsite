    <richText>The last couple of weeks have been quite hectic. Not only on work have there been plenty to deal with. Also in my precious spare time have I been overloaded. After I came back from DK I dived right into my work again, only to be &#x2018;distracted&#x2019; by my birthday. As last year Gisella and I decided to throw a small party to celebrate ourselves and the fact that we are not getting younger... 27... damn :s&#xD;Well at least it was meant to be a small party but since Gisella is italian and they are counted on at leas 4 hands :) Further more a year of socializing in Heidelberg indeed expands the circle of friends, so in the end we manage to push my apartment to its limit - at some point I counted &gt;50 people. This was just enough to crowd the place so the party was awesome, but still not so many that you couldn&#x2019;t move. The day after my apartment looked like s*** and since I wasn&#x2019;t really in the mood to clean in the morning I went to Hauptstrasse to buy myself a couple of presents... come on I was allowed - it was my birthday!&#xD;This week (after having recovered completely from my birthday party) I was going on a retreat to Maulbrunn with the rest of the Galaxy &amp; Cosmology department at MPIA. It was a mandatory trip, which actually didn&#x2019;t fit into my working schedule that well... but what can you do. It turned out to be a nice trip even though the program was a bit tight. However, the surroundings were awesome (I&#x2019;ve added some  pictures at my web gallery) and the food was okayish.&#xD;The next week I have a pretty long to-do list before I (hopefully - if the damn volcano doesn&#x2019;t erupt abruptly again...) fly to DK to celebrate my cousins confirmation and to spend some time with Mette.&#xD;So all in all it has been a great April.&#xD;&#xD;Till then...&#xD;Cheers</richText>
