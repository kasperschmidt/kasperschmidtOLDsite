    <richText>Yet another moth passed by... and yet another time it&#x2019;s been a busy one. Since last time I have been to a couple of meetings, attended a summer school, a week in DK including a baptism (pics are uploaded) and in Stuttgart to get a bit of October fest feeling this year as well. It was tough, but great fun - except that this year you apparently needed a reservation to get into the tent in the evening, since it was crowded like hell. But it was great fun in the end either way. Actually I wasn&#x2019;t planing to write another novel, simply wanted to say high and wish you all a good autumn... or something. The next couple of weeks will be focused on mostly work since I have some observations in December to prepare and another project to get on tracks... and then Mette will show up :D&#xD;But I think I&#x2019;ll stop here... am pretty tired after yesterdays October partying&#xD;&#xD;cheerszzzzzZZZZ&#xD;KBS&#xD;</richText>
